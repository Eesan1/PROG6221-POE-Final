WPF application

How to compile and run the software

1.	The first thing you need to do is to ensure that you have all the files necessary, this includes:
  a.	MainWindow.xaml
  b.	MainWindow.xmal.cs
  c.	App.xmal
  d.	App.xmal.cs
  e.	AssemblyInfo.cs
  f.	AddRecipe.xmal
  g.	AddRecipe.xmal.cs
  h.	DisplayRecipeWindow.xmal
  i.	DisplayRecipeWindow.xmal.cs
  j.	ScaleWindow.xmal
  k.	ScaleWindow.xmal.cs
  l.	Recipe.cs
  m.	ST10257419WPFApp.csproj
2.	Then open up the terminal and type the command ‘cd…(file path)’ to go to the specific file.
3.	Then once you are in the correct file path, type the command ‘dotnet run’. This will run the application.
4.	The application will have multiple options that you are able to select and use, but the first thing you are required to do is to select the option to add a new recipe.
5.	You will then be prompted to enter the details of the recipe.
6.	For the ingredients you are required to type the first ingredient details in then select the option to ‘add ingredients’, the data will then be recorded and you can repeat the process again depending       on how many ingredients you have.
7.	For the Steps, it works just like the ingredients. You will type out the first step then select the option ‘add step’, the step will then be recorded an you will be able to add the next step. Repeat        this process depending on how many steps you have. All steps and ingredients will be recorded as long as you add the every time you finish.
8.	You will then select the ‘save recipe’ option, this will record the recipe for later use.
9.	You can continue adding more recipes or you can display the recipe which will allow you to perform the following actions:
  a.	Scale the recipe- this will allow you to multiply the quantity of ingredients by one of three amounts (0.5, 2 and 3).
  b.	Reset the recipe- this will reset the scaled recipe and return the original values.
  c.	Clear the recipe- this will clear the writing on the screen.
10.	You can then select the ‘list all recipes option’ this will list the names of all the recipes that were created.
11.	Then you will have the option to delete a recipe.
12.	You can then use the search bar at the bottom to view recipes that meet certain criteria.

Changes made to part 2

I did not receive any feedback, but I have made a couple of changes to my part 2. Mainly logical changes but I also added a unit test, as I was missing that in part 2 previously. I also added a few more comments.
